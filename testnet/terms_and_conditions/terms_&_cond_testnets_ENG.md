*Important: These Terms and Conditions will be effective on LACChain Testnets as of 15 June 2022*

**TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE FOR LACNET TESTNET NODE OPERATORS**

**PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE (THIS "AGREEMENT") CAREFULLY. IT IS A LEGAL AND BINDING CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK OPERATOR FOR LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (L-NET) (“L-NET”). THIS AGREEMENT APPLIES TO THE USE OF THE LACNET TEST NETWORKS (“LACNET TESTNETS”) AND THE CAPABILITIES AND INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THEIR USE. BY CONTINUING WITH THE NODE DEPLOYMENT PROCESS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY IT IN ITS ENTIRETY. IF YOU ARE REGISTERING TO USE THE LACNET TESTNETS ON BEHALF OF AN ORGANIZATION OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH LEGAL ENTITY TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND THAT SUCH ENTITY EXISTS AND IS IN GOOD STANDING. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE LEGAL ENTITY WILL BE BOUND BY AND RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE TERMS DESCRIBED HEREIN, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE YOUR USE OF THE LACNET TESTNETS.**

LACNET TESTNETS are blockchain testing networks orchestrated by L-NET. L-NET is an international non-government organization legally incorporated in Uruguay and recognized by the Uruguayan Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The main purpose of L-NET is to manage, operate, and facilitate L-NET's blockchain infrastructure and DLT and other related resources for the benefit of the LACChain community in particular and of the region of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) in general; to provide services related to the establishment and operation of a digital trust infrastructure based on DLT and blockchain infrastructure managed by L-NET, and to collaborate in the growth of blockchain and the implementation of DLT technologies in the region of Latin America and the Caribbean. The LACNET TESTNETS provide services that allow any entity to operate a node. The entities operating a writer node can send transactional data to the network for the purpose of developing proofs of concept or testing applications using blockchain technology. The LACNET TESTNETS are for the benefit of users who have registered on the LACNET TESTNETS (“Users”). Users will have access to and use of the LACNET TESTNET infrastructure and will have permission to generate transactions with certain types of Content. After you agree to this Agreement and once your registration (“Registration”) is accepted, you will become a User for the purpose of this Agreement. It should be noted that, as used herein, the term Users always refers to the entities that operate nodes, not to potential end users, services or off-chain applications that interact indirectly with these nodes. LACNET TESTNETS seek to provide service infrastructure for the deployment of proofs-of-concept and testing applications using blockchain technologies.

**LACNET TESTNET REGISTRATION**

To access the full functionality of the LACNET TESTNETS, you must register as a User through any means offered on the LACNET TESTNET. As part of the registration process, you must (i) identify a person of contact within your organization who will be responsible for the administration of the node and who can be contacted for any technical issue, (ii) identify a commercial or administration person of contact for any communication between L-NET and the User, (iii) specify precisely the type of information and content that will be registered in the blockchain, and (iv) specify if any entity other than the User will have access to the writer node. If your registration is accepted, you will be assigned a user identification code (“User Identification”). You will have access to various Content and system resources associated with your User Identification as determined by L-NET at its sole discretion, which L-NET may modify, terminate, increase or decrease at its sole discretion and at any time. You also acknowledge that you assume all liability for any Content that is posted using your User Identification, including any transactional data (as defined below). You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs using your User Identification, so you must keep your access credentials secure. You must notify L-NET immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your User Identification, and you must not use any User Identification without the permission of the relevant User. Although L-NET will not be liable for any losses you may incur due to the unauthorized use of your User Identification, you may be liable for the losses that L-NET or others may incur due to such unauthorized use. L-NET will notify users about any personal information data security breach or intrusion by third parties.

The LACNET TESTNETS and the Services are provided for professional use only, and by registering as a User, you acknowledge that the Services and any Content may not be used for personal, family, or household purposes.

The LACNET TESTNETS and the Services are provided by L-NET free of charge and on a temporary basis. L-NET reserves the right to discontinue the LACNET TESTNETS and the Services, in whole or in part, or to accept, deny or revoke any Registration and the associated User Identification, at any time, at its sole discretion, for any reason, or for no reason at all.

**TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER DATA SENT TO THE LACNET TESTNET**

You may enable a writer node or send transactional data to the LACNET TESTNETS in connection with your use of the Services. You hereby grant to L-NET a nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual, assignable, transferable and royalty-free right to copy, produce derivative works, distribute, transmit, display, publish, retain, translate, analyze, and use (including alone or as part of a collective work), in any way now known or in the future discovered, any transactional data you provide directly or indirectly in connection with L-NET’s offerings on the LACNET TESTNETS and/or the Services, and to publish your name in connection with your transactional data, without any further consent or notice to you or to any third party. All of the rights listed above are referred to as “Licenses”. Unless you have a separate written agreement with L-NET to provide services to L-NET for compensation, no compensation will be paid to you or to any third party with respect to the use of your transactional data and the License as provided in this document. The personal data of the users of the LACNET TESTNETS will not be considered transactional data.

By submitting any transaction to LACNET TESTNETS, you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to submit such transaction, and that the transaction is legal, non-private, non-confidential, and does not violate any contractual limitations or the rights of third parties. You represent and warrant that you own any copyrighted material which is included in the application, or that you have all the rights and authorizations required to grant to L-NET and other Users the License, and any other rights granted under this Agreement. You further represent and warrant that you have the financial, intellectual, and human resources required to execute the proposed blockchain services.

You understand and agree that L-NET may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, assess, edit, filter or validate any Content. Likewise, L-NET has no obligation to verify the identity of the persons who register on the LACNET TESTNETS or to monitor the use of the Services. L-NET will not be a party to or in any way responsible for monitoring any transaction between you and any other User or any other third party. L-NET reserves the right to reject any transaction sent by you, or to deny, restrict, suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the TELNET TESTNETS or the Services at any time, with or without notice or explanation, if L-NET suspects that these terms of reference may have been violated. L-NET has no obligation to store, maintain, or provide you a copy of any Content that you or other Users provide when using the Services, whether during the term of your Registration or after its termination. You are solely responsible for creating backup copies of your transactional data and of any electronic communications sent or received by you using the Services.

**INFORMATION, FEEDBACK AND CONFIDENTIALITY**

The LACNET TESTNET, any information relating to the progress and results of any testing, or any information relating to the product or any other proprietary technology or know-how provided to you by L-NET in whatever form in connection with the testing and evaluation of the LACNET TESTNETS is considered confidential (“Confidential Information”).

You will keep and ensure that any person, firm, company or organization associated with you will keep all Confidential Information in confidence and will not disclose such Confidential Information to any person except as permitted under this clause. This confidentiality obligation does not apply to the disclosure of information which: (a) is or comes into public domain, except through breach of the confidentiality obligation under this clause; (b) comes lawfully into your possession from a third party who is not bound by a confidentiality obligation relating to such Confidential Information; (c) is required to be disclosed by any competent court or by any competent judicial, governmental, supervisory or regulatory body, or by any law, provided that you promptly notify L-NET in writing; or (d) is disclosed by you with the prior written consent of L-NET.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE MAY ANY INFORMATION REGARDING THE TESTING PROGRESS AND/OR RESULTS BE PROVIDED TO PERSONS NOT INVOLVED IN THE TESTING PROCESS. ANY PUBLICATION OF TESTING RESULTS, REVIEWS OR EVALUATIONS IS ONLY PERMITTED WITH THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF L-NET.

You will provide L-NET feedback about the LACNET TESTNETS, consisting of, without limitation, your suggestions, comments, or any other feedback, whether required or offered voluntarily. If you provide feedback to L-NET as part of the testing and evaluation of the LACNET TESTNET, you agree that: (a) L-NET may freely use, disclose, reproduce, license, distribute, and otherwise commercialize the Feedback in any product, specification or other documentation; and (b) you will not give L-NET any Feedback (i) that you have reason to believe is subject to any patent, copyright or other intellectual property claim or right of any third party; or (ii) that is subject to license terms that seek to require that any L-NET product incorporating or derived from any Feedback, or other L-NET intellectual property, be licensed or otherwise shared with any third parties; and (iii) no compensation will be paid to you or to any third party with respect to the provision of any feedback for the improvement of the test network.

**LIABILTIY**

As part of your registration, you are providing L-NET with information about the types of data you plan to register in the LACNET TESTNETS. L-NET reserves the right to unilaterally deny or revoke access to the LACNET TESTNETS. A list of prohibited activities is included in Annex A. You are also providing information about a contact person responsible for the use of the writer node in your entity. Should the User intend to make changes related to the data and transactions to be registered, the contact person, the third parties using the writer node or any other matter that affects these Terms and Conditions, this must be notified to and approved by L-NET.

YOU WILL BE FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPERATION OF THE WRITER NODE AND THE USE OF THE LACNET INFRASTRUCTURE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE WILL YOU TRANSFER OR DELEGATE RESPONSIBILITY TO OTHERS. IF THE USER WISHES TO ALLOW ANY THIRD PARTY TO USE THEIR WRITER NODE TO SEND INFORMATION OR TRANSACTIONS TO THE LACNET TESTNET, THE USER (I) MUST NOTIFY L-NET, (II) MUST BE AUTHORIZED BY L-NET, AND (III) ASSUMES FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY USE OF THEIR WRITER NODE BY THE THIRD PARTY.

This Agreement will be governed, interpreted, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Uruguay. Notwithstanding the provisions of the following item, the Uruguayan courts in Montevideo shall be competent to hear any matters excluded from arbitration, the proceedings prior to arbitration, the execution of the award, and the appeal for its annulment, as provided in the General Code of Procedure. No waiver by L-NET of any provision of this Agreement shall be binding, except as set forth in writing and signed by its duly authorized representative.

All disputes between you and L-NET arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be resolved by arbitration before the Conciliation and Arbitration Center of the Uruguayan Stock Exchange (“the Center”), following the provisions set forth in the Center’s Rules of Arbitration. The arbitrators shall be three in number, the seat of the arbitration shall be the city of Montevideo, and the procedure shall be conducted in Spanish. The party that initially resorts to arbitration shall notify the Secretary General of the Center and the other party of their intention to submit a matter to arbitration, fully in accordance with the “Arbitration Procedure” rules of the Center's Regulations. When the arbitration agreement is granted (which must be granted within 15 calendar days of the notification mentioned above), each party shall appoint an arbitrator of their choice or, failing that, the Center shall appoint an arbitrator selected from their roster. Within ten calendar days of their appointment, the arbitrators thus appointed shall appoint a third arbitrator and, should no agreement be reached within the following five calendar days, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the Center from among the members of its Arbitration Body. The third arbitrator shall preside over the Arbitration Court. The ruling of the Arbitration Court may not be appealed, with the exception of an appeal for annulment provided for in the General Code of Procedure.

ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN EACH PARTY'S  INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS ACTION PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS YOU AND L-NET AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE THE CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND L-NET ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. NOTHING IN THIS CLAUSE OR THIS AGREEMENT SHALL OPERATE AS A WAIVER OF, OR OTHERWISE BE CONSTRUED TO RESTRICT, LIMIT OR DEFEAT ANY RIGHT, PRIVILEGE OR IMMUNITY GRANTED TO L-NET UNDER THE AGREEMENT ESTABLISHING THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK OR ANY TREATY OR PROVISION OF DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL LAW.

**ASSIGNMENT**

Any rights and licenses granted under this Agreement may not be transferred or assigned by you but may be assigned by L-NET without restriction.

**GENERAL**

This Agreement is between you and L-NET in connection with your use of the LACNET TESTNETS and the Services, and supersedes any prior agreements or understandings between you and L-NET with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and L-NET as a result of this Agreement or your use of the LACNET TESTNETS. L-NET's performance of this Agreement is subject to existing laws and legal processes, and nothing contained in this Agreement is in derogation of L-NET's right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to the use of the LACNET TESTNETS or the Services or information provided to or collected by L-NET with respect to such use. If any part of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed superseded by the valid and enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in effect. Should you need to contact L-NET under this Agreement, or should you need to contact L-NET with respect to the LACNET TESTNETS or the Services, please send your communication to tech-support@lac-net.net.

**MODIFICATION OF THESE TERMS OF USE**

L-NET reserves the right to modify this Agreement and to change the terms and conditions under which the LACNET TESTNETS and the Services are offered. Such modification shall be effective when it is published on https://github.com/LACNetNetworks/besu-networks/tree/master/testnet/terms_and_conditions. Your continued use of the LACNET TESTNETS or the Services after the revised Agreement is posted means that you accept the revised Agreement in its entirety. You should therefore review this Agreement regularly and when we notify you of any changes thereto.
